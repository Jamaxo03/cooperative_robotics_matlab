%% ROBUST UVMS TASK-PRIORITY EXERCISE
% This script assembles the main blocks of the control architecture:
%
%   task definitions -> ActionManager/iCAT -> kinematic simulator -> Unity
%
% At every iteration, the Kinematic Control Layer computes the system velocity ydot = [q_dot; v_nu].
% UvmsSim integrates this reference directly; in a real robot, a Dynamic Control Layer would track the same reference.
%
% Run this script with the current MATLAB folder set to the template root so that the relative paths below resolve consistently.
